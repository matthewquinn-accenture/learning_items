# JavaScript Testing Environment Setup

The following is **one** of many ways to set up a JavaScript testing environment. In this example, we will use _Mocha_ and _Chai_ to test, _Babel_ for es6 syntax, _VS_ _Code_ for the text editor, and _npm_ as our package manager.

The following process will be done from the command line.

1. ```mkdir my_directory_name```

In this step, we create a base directory for our project.

2.1 ```mkdir my_directory_name/src```
2.2 ```mkdir my_directory_name/test```

In this step, we create a `src` and `test` sub-directory inside of our base directory. The `src` sub-directory will hold our application code. The `test` sub-directory will hold the tests for our application code.
